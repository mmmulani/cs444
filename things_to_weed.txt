As per http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/first_edition/html/8.doc.html#41652,
the name of a constructor must match the name of the class that contains it.

Cast expressions with reference types should be followed by a unary 
expression that does not start with a plus or minus.

Check modifiers based on context, e.g. no native classes
